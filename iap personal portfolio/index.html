      Once I attained 3 years of age, I was enrolled at Peakview School where I stayed until class six, 
      and then I was transferred to Lily Academy where I did my KCPE. I was called to attend high school 
      at Karima Girls High School, located at Kinangop. Upon completion, I joined Jomo Kenyatta University 
      of Agriculture and Technology to attain a degree in Computer Science.
